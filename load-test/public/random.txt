To Dan

    By Paul Laurence Dunbar



    Step me now a bridal measure,
    Work give way to love and leisure,
    Hearts be free and hearts be gay--
    Doctor Dan doth wed to-day.

    Diagnosis, cease your squalling--
    Check that scalpel's senseless bawling,
    Put that ugly knife away--
    Doctor Dan doth wed to-day.

    'Tis no time for things unsightly,
    Life's the day and life goes lightly;
    Science lays aside her sway--
    Love rules Dr. Dan to-day.

    Gather, gentlemen and ladies,
    For the nuptial feast now made is,
    Swing your garlands, chant your lay
    For the pair who wed to-day.

    Wish them happy days and many,
    Troubles few and griefs not any,
    Lift your brimming cups and say
    God bless them who wed to-day.

    Then a cup to Cupid daring,
    Who for conquest ever faring,
    With his arrows dares assail
    E'en a doctor's coat of mail.

    So with blithe and happy hymning
    And with harmless goblets brimming,
    Dance a step--musicians play--
    Doctor Dan doth wed to-day.
